# shufflesort-c
Showcasing Fisher-Yates Shuffle and Insertion Sort

This program is to demonstrate shuffling and sorting using Fisher-Yates Shuffle and Insertion Sort. 

## Input
The input is `n` which determines the length of the array to be shuffled and sorted, and `m` which determines the number of iterations for shuffling and sorting an array.

## Output
The output is a tally of the amount of swaps required to sort a shuffled array (using the specified algorithms) and its average.
